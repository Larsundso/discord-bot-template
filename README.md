# Discord Bot Sharding Template
This is a template for a discord bot that uses sharding. It is written in TypeScript and uses the Discord.js library.


# Discord Bot Template
You can easily convert this sharding template into a template that doesnt use sharding
by deleting index.ts and renaming bot.ts into index.ts instead.
However, I recommend you to move the process events inside the old index.ts into the new index.ts.
